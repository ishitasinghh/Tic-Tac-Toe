# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

  <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game repository! This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns to place their symbols on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a winning alignment of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. Player 1 starts with the symbol 'O', and Player 2 starts with 'X'. The game provides a 'New Game' or 'Reset' button to start fresh rounds.</p>
